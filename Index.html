        <h3>Cloning</h3>
        Cloning is the process of taking genetic information from one living thing and creating identical copies of it. The copied material is called a clone. Geneticists have cloned cells, tissues, genes and entire animals. 
        Although this process may seem futuristic, nature has been doing it for millions of years. For example, identical twins have almost identical DNA, and asexual reproduction in some plants and organisms can produce genetically identical offspring. And scientists make genetic doubles in the lab, though the process is a little different.

        <h3>Gmo's</h3>
    Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are plants, animals or microorganisms whose genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally. GMO technology can introduce individual genes from one organism into another and even across species
    
    <p>Most popular GMO's</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Maize</li>
    <li>Papaya</li>
    <li>Cotten</li>
    <li>Canola</li>
    <li>Soybean</li>
    <li>Alfalfa</li>
    <li>Sugar Beet</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Squash</li>
    <li>Potato</li>

<h3>Selective Breeding</h3>
Selective breeding, also known as artificial selection, is a process used by humans to develop new organisms with desirable characteristics. Breeders select two parents that have beneficial phenotypic traits to reproduce, yielding offspring with those desired traits

<h4>Types of selective breeding</h4>
    <li>Hypridnaztion</li>
        <ul>Cross breeding:Crossing individuals with different desirable traits are breed </ul>
    <li>Inbreeding</li>
        <ul>Breed from closely related people or animals, especially over many generations</ul>

<h3>DNA fingerprinting</h3>
There are various methods for analyzing DNA to establish if two samples are the same or different. This is sometimes referred to as DNA fingerprinting. For example, two cloned pieces of DNA can be studied in the laboratory to determine if they have portions in common, and thus overlap with one another. In a different setting, such as a crime scene, DNA samples can be collected and analyzed to determine if they match DNA samples obtained from suspects of that crime. If two DNA samples have the same fingerprint, then there is a very high statistical likelihood that they came from the same person. Such an approach can also be used to establish paternity.
